Paygapstimator

The Paygapstimator is a web application that uses machine learning to predict salaries and compare estimated salaries between women and men. This project aims to raise awareness of gender pay gap issues by providing a tool that allows users to input various features (such as age, education level, job title, and years of experience) and obtain salary predictions. The application utilizes scikit-learn for machine learning and Flask for the web interface.

This application can be used to help women understand if they're being paid fairly in their current roles and equips them with data-driven evidence to negotiate for equal pay. Employers can also use it to identify and address gender pay disparities within their organizations, promoting equality and empowerment.
